<h1>A Graph Based Algorithm For Solving The Compatible Pair Problem</h1>
Compatible Pair Problem is an algorithmic mathematical problem aimed at choosing the right pairs within a group of items based on the preferences set for each items with respect to other items. The preferences are quantified in some mathematical parameters. It falls in the category of matching and assignment problem in which items of two disjoint sets are matched and groups are formed from them while in this problem pairing is done within a single set. The objective is to pair the items of a set in such a way that it maximizes the profit which in this case is the compatibility among different pairs of items. To tackle the mentioned problem graph based algorithm is used. One of the applications of this problem is finding the right partner within a class of students based on the likes and dislikes information given by each student. Students are represented as the vertices of the graph, The likes contribute positive edge weight and the dislikes contribute negative edge weight, each vertices have two weights associated with them representing the count of likes and dislikes for the vertices from every other vertex. Using the information of likes and dislikes given by each student with respect to other students the main objective is to maximize the satisfaction level of students according to the preferences given by them.
